      "summary": "A 15th century illustrated codex written in an unknown script and language that has never been deciphered. Contains approximately 240 pages with botanical, astronomical, and biological illustrations. Genuinely unexplained despite centuries of study.",
      "full": "The Voynich Manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown script, dating from the early 15th century (1404-1438 CE based on carbon dating). The manuscript is named after Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish book dealer who purchased it in 1912. Despite extensive study by professional and amateur cryptographers, linguists, and historians, the manuscript's text has never been convincingly deciphered. The book contains approximately 240 vellum pages with colorful illustrations of unidentified plants, astronomical diagrams, nude figures in strange plumbing systems, and mysterious pharmaceutical recipes. The writing system appears consistent and shows statistical properties of natural language, but its meaning remains unknown. Theories range from encrypted medieval herbal to elaborate hoax to constructed language. The manuscript is currently housed at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library. This represents a genuinely unsolved historical mystery under active scholarly investigation."
